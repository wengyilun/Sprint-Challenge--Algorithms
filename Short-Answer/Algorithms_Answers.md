## Exercise I

a) It has a linear time complexity O(n) and a O(1) space complexity
Because the number of operations grow at the same rate as the the value of n grows.



b) Time complexity is O(1)
since while loop will always get called once as j always grows at quadratic speed while for loop grows at linear speed. So, there will always be O(1) get called
Space complexity will also be O(1)



c) Time complexity is O(1) operation for each call stack, multiply it by levels of call stacks O(n). The Total is O(1) x O(n) = O(n)
Space complexity is O(n) because each call stackâ€™s returned result needs to be stored in memory before the final result is returned.
